# TundraTest ‚ùÑ

Unit test services for [Tundra], a package of cool services for
[webMethods Integration Server] 7.1 and higher.

## Installation

This project contains the unit test services for the [Tundra]
package, but is not a [webMethods Integration Server] package
itself. Instead, it is intended to be symlinked directly into an
existing installation of the [Tundra] package.

To install, first make sure that:

* Git is [installed](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your
  Integration Server.
* Your Integration Server has internet access to https://github.com
  (for cloning the repository).
* The [Tundra] package is installed and enabled on your Integration
  Server.

Choose a new directory in which to store this project within your
Integration Server installation directory other than the packages
directory, since this project is not a package.

Then from your Integration Server installation directory clone this
project into your chosen directory, then symlink the unit test
services into the Tundra package:

### Windows

```sh
$ mkdir .\test\packages\
$ git clone https://github.com/Permafrost/TundraTest.git .\test\packages\TundraTest
$ # symlink the test services into the Tundra package
$ mklink /d .\packages\Tundra\ns\tundra\support\test .\test\packages\TundraTest\ns\tundra\support\test
```
### *nix

```sh
$ mkdir ./test/packages/
$ git clone https://github.com/Permafrost/TundraTest.git ./test/packages/TundraTest
$ ln -s ./test/packages/TundraTest/ns/tundra/support/test  ./packages/Tundra/ns/tundra/support/test
```

Then reload the [Tundra] package in your Integration Server to complete the installation.

## Upgrading

From your Integration Server installation:

```sh
$ cd ./test/packages/TundraTest/
$ git pull
```

Then reload the [Tundra] package in your Integration Server to complete the upgrade.

## Testing

To execute the unit test suite either:

* Run the `Tundra/tundra:test($package = "Tundra")` service directly, or
* Visit the <http://server:port/invoke/tundra/test?$package=Tundra> web page.
